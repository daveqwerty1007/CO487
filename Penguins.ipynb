More common formats like JPEG or PNG images are either lossy or use compression (or both), and dealing with that is completely irrelevant to the cryptography in the question, and is also tedious and annoying. PPM files are good for this question because they are uncompressed, lossless bitmap files, making it easy to see patterns that may emerge when images are improperly encrypted.\n",

For this reason, to view your encrypted (or decrypted) images, it may be easiest to use the `display_image()` function provided in this notebook.
